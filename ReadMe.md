# Avatar

An homemade engine (and demo game) to learn how to create game engines and fun.

## About this project

This project is _very personal_ to me. It's not a **profesional work**, only a fun project for me. I've just opensourced it
because it keeps me motivated.

It's kind of a background idea I've got in mind since like a child : 

> What if I can live in an universe where every of the imaginary Universes I read/watch/play about exists alltogether ?

Like imagine living in a world where an Imperial Star destroyer can cross the Tardis and lands in the Middle Earth ? Kind of
crazy huh ?

Then I discovered programming, then VR... then Ready Player One (the good one, the book, not _the other one_) and I said : 
why not ?

In fact, it's because the Stargate franchise is marked by a curse which prevents any game to actually show up, that I decided 
this. Damn, that _I WANT_ to live something in the Stargate universe. That's why this project is called `Avatar` after all : in
Stargate's Season 7, there's an episode called Avatar where the protagonists lived in a simulation of their base, just like VR. 
Reproducing this sounds like a good start for me.

## Disclaimers

### About intellictual property

It's clear that I **DO NOT** possess any assets or authorization from copyright holders of the universes I'm gonna import. I 
opensource the engine, and parts of the game. But anything related to directly copyrighted content (assets, music, effects...) 
will not be shared, I'll keep this for myself and myself only. The only thing I'll share will be the videos of built's demo.

And no, I'll **not share in anyway** the builts I made with all the assets. Neither do I'll make money with them.


### About this project

Again, this project is _very personal_. Which means I may accept contributions (in terms of PR or issues), but only if I'm 
ok with what they introduce. If I don't see the point or don't want the subject in Avatar, I'll close them and suggest the author
to fork the project.

I'll also manage the repo the way I want it :

* Commit messages will be more like dev log entries. I miss John Carmack's .plan files or the Prince of Persia journals.
* No big issue templating with uses cases/epics/... I treat issue like post its. Few info on them are good for me.
* No public roadmap on several months in the future. I have a general idea of where this project will go. And I'm prepared to
  never see the end of it.
